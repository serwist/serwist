# Adding a new feature

Anyone can propose a change. However, adding new features often requires community discussions before proceeding with the implementation.

Therefore, before opening a PR, you should use the [Feature Request discussion template](https://github.com/DuCanhGH/next-pwa/discussions/new?category=ideas) and collect feedback.

## Why use a discussion?

The discussion's goal is to achieve the following:

1. **Verify the validity of the feature request**: The community can upvote discussions. Highly upvoted feature requests are more likely to be considered.
2. **Understanding the consequences**: Any feature added is likely to be around for a long time. This means that a new feature has to cover use cases, needs to consider how it affects users.
