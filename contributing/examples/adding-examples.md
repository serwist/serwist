## Adding examples

When you add an example to the [examples](https://github.com/DuCanhGH/next-pwa/tree/master/examples) directory, please follow these guidelines:

- TypeScript should be leveraged for new examples.
- If API routes aren't used in an example, they should be omitted.
- If an example exists for a certain library and you would like to showcase a specific feature of that library, the existing example should be updated (instead of adding a new example).
- Package manager specific config should not be added (e.g. `resolutions` in `package.json`).
- Dependencies' versions should be up-to-date (you can run `pnpm deps` in this repo's root directory to update everything in it).
- Use `const Page = () => <></>; export default Page;` for page components and `export const GET = () => {}` for API Routes.
- Example directories should not be prefixed with `with-`.
- Make sure linting passes (you can run `pnpm build && pnpm examples:lint` to verify and `pnpm examples:lint -- --fix` for automatic fixes).
- Avoid running `pnpm examples:build` as it is resource-heavy.

Also, don’t forget to add a `README.md` file with the following format:

- Replace `DIRECTORY_NAME` with the directory name you’re adding.
- Fill in `next-pwa - Example Name` and `DESCRIPTION`.
- To add additional notes, add `## Notes` section at the end.

````markdown
# next-pwa - Example Name

This example demonstrates how to use `next-pwa` with DESCRIPTION.
