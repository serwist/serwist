fix(svelte,next,vite): force `defaultCache` to only use `NetworkOnly` in development mode

- This is to prevent files from being accidentally cached during development mode, which isn't the behaviour you would expect to see anyway.

- URLs that are matched by these entries in production are now handled by `NetworkOnly` in development. No option to override this behaviour is provided, for it would provide little to no value. If you do need runtime caching to work during development, you have to copy `defaultCache` into your code.

- As a reminder for those who extend `defaultCache`, it should be placed below any custom entry, since such an entry wouldn't ever be matched otherwise.
