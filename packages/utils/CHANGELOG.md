### Major Changes

- [`defdd5a`](https://github.com/serwist/serwist/commit/defdd5a50f80e6c58e00dff8c608466c02fdc459) Thanks [@DuCanhGH](https://github.com/DuCanhGH)! - refactor(js): migrate to ESM-only

  - Serwist is now an ESM-only project.
  - This was done because our tooling around supporting CJS had always been crappy: it was slow, had no way of supporting emitting `.d.cts` (we used to copy `.d.ts` to `.d.cts`), and was too error-prone (there were various issues of our builds crashing due to an ESM-only package slipping in).
  - If you already use ESM, there's nothing to be done. Great! Otherwise, to migrate:

    - Migrate to ESM if possible.
    - Otherwise, use dynamic imports. For example, to migrate to the new `@serwist/next`:

      - Old:

      ```js
      // @ts-check
      const withSerwist = require("@serwist/next").default({
        cacheOnNavigation: true,
        swSrc: "app/sw.ts",
        swDest: "public/sw.js",
      });
      /** @type {import("next").NextConfig} */
      const nextConfig = {
        reactStrictMode: true,
      };

      module.exports = withSerwist(nextConfig);
      ```

      - New:

      ```js
      // @ts-check
      /** @type {import("next").NextConfig} */
      const nextConfig = {
        reactStrictMode: true,
      };

      module.exports = async () => {
        const withSerwist = (await import("@serwist/next")).default({
          cacheOnNavigation: true,
          swSrc: "app/sw.ts",
          swDest: "public/sw.js",
        });
        return withSerwist(nextConfig);
      };
      ```

  - I know that most of our current userbase use Next.js, which still suggests using a CJS config file, so I am really sorry for the trouble I have caused for you :( However, what needs to be done has to be done. It was time to migrate and get rid of old, legacy things.
