### Major Changes

- [#123](https://github.com/serwist/serwist/pull/123) [`7b55ac5`](https://github.com/serwist/serwist/commit/7b55ac526a73826cb2d179a863d7eb29182616ee) Thanks [@DuCanhGH](https://github.com/DuCanhGH)! - refactor(js): dropped the CommonJS build

  - Serwist is now an ESM-only project.
  - This was done because our tooling around supporting CJS had always been crappy: it was slow, had no way of supporting emitting `.d.cts` (we used to copy `.d.ts` to `.d.cts`), and was too error-prone (there were various issues of our builds crashing due to an ESM-only package slipping in).
  - If you already use ESM, there's nothing to be done. Great! Otherwise, to migrate:

    - Migrate to ESM if possible.
    - Otherwise, use dynamic imports. For example, to migrate to the new `@serwist/next`:

      - Old:

      ```js
      // @ts-check
      const withSerwist = require("@serwist/next").default({
        cacheOnNavigation: true,
        swSrc: "app/sw.ts",
        swDest: "public/sw.js",
      });
      /** @type {import("next").NextConfig} */
      const nextConfig = {
        reactStrictMode: true,
      };

      module.exports = withSerwist(nextConfig);
      ```

      - New:

      ```js
      // @ts-check
      /** @type {import("next").NextConfig} */
      const nextConfig = {
        reactStrictMode: true,
      };

      module.exports = async () => {
        const withSerwist = (await import("@serwist/next")).default({
          cacheOnNavigation: true,
          swSrc: "app/sw.ts",
          swDest: "public/sw.js",
        });
        return withSerwist(nextConfig);
      };
      ```

    - If all else fails, use `require(esm)`. This may or may not be supported on your current Node.js version.

### Patch Changes

- 6d294f9: refactor: migrate to GitLab

  - Serwist and `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` have migrated to GitLab.
  - This was the result of GitHub flagging my account, organizations, and repositories as spam. Sorry for the inconvenience.

### Major Changes

- [`ea0944c`](https://github.com/serwist/serwist/commit/ea0944c5b7b9d39cecda423e1e60b7bd11723063) Thanks [@DuCanhGH](https://github.com/DuCanhGH)! - refactor: use iterables

  - Serwist now uses iterables in its code. For instance, `Headers.prototype.entries()` can be noticed at parts of `@serwist/cacheable-response`.
  - This is partly thanks to our Node.js requirement being bumped to 18.0.0. Iterables have been supported in all major browsers for ages, so they wouldn't be a problem (hell, all browsers that support service workers have support for iterables).
  - Still, since this requires us to enforce the use of Node.js 18.0.0 or later, it is marked a breaking change.

- [`defdd5a`](https://github.com/serwist/serwist/commit/defdd5a50f80e6c58e00dff8c608466c02fdc459) Thanks [@DuCanhGH](https://github.com/DuCanhGH)! - refactor(js): migrate to ESM-only

  - Serwist is now an ESM-only project.
  - This was done because our tooling around supporting CJS had always been crappy: it was slow, had no way of supporting emitting `.d.cts` (we used to copy `.d.ts` to `.d.cts`), and was too error-prone (there were various issues of our builds crashing due to an ESM-only package slipping in).

      ```js
      // @ts-check
      const withSerwist = require("@serwist/next").default({
        cacheOnNavigation: true,
        swSrc: "app/sw.ts",
        swDest: "public/sw.js",
      });
      /** @type {import("next").NextConfig} */
      const nextConfig = {
        reactStrictMode: true,
      };

      module.exports = withSerwist(nextConfig);
      ```

      - New:

      ```js
      // @ts-check
      /** @type {import("next").NextConfig} */
      const nextConfig = {
        reactStrictMode: true,
      };

      module.exports = async () => {
        const withSerwist = (await import("@serwist/next")).default({
          cacheOnNavigation: true,
          swSrc: "app/sw.ts",
          swDest: "public/sw.js",
        });
        return withSerwist(nextConfig);
      };
      ```

  - I know that most of our current userbase use Next.js, which still suggests using a CJS config file, so I am really sorry for the trouble I have caused for you :( However, what needs to be done has to be done. It was time to migrate and get rid of old, legacy things.
